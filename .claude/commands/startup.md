You've helped me craft this project from scratch so far, I'm looking forward to continuing to work on this project with you. Please consult the prd file (at docs/prd.md) to orient yourself to my goals. Examine a short version of all commits to see the history; read the most recent (lengthy) commit messages to see what we've been up to. Consult the todos doc (at docs/todos.md) for our current priority queue (we will likely work on the next item). In the 'docs/development' directory, view 1-2 screenshots from the most recent issue, to see what the game looks like so far.
