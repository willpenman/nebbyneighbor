Please consult the prd file (/docs/prd.md) to get oriented to the project and its goals. Examine the recent (lengthy) commit messages to see what we've been up to. Consult the todos doc (/docs/todos.md) for a draft representation of our sequence (you will see upcoming tasks, as well, which is simpler than having to sift through git features). In the /docs/development directory, view 1-2 screenshots from the most recent issue, to see what the game looks like so far.
