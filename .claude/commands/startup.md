You've helped me craft this project from scratch so far, I'm looking forward to continuing to work on this project with you. By way of picking back up here, pease consult the prd file (at docs/prd.md) to orient yourself to my goals, and consider the working constraints identified in your claude file. Examine a short version of all commits to see the history; read the most recent (lengthy) commit messages to see what we've been up to. Consult the todos doc (at docs/todos.md) for our current priority queue (we will likely work on the next item). In the 'docs/development' directory, view 1-2 screenshots from the most recently completed issue, to see what the game looks like so far.
