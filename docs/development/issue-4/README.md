# Issue #4: Load one solvable 4×4 puzzle with some pre-placed neighbors

## Implementation Summary  

Successfully implemented puzzle loading system with visual distinction between pre-placed and player-placed neighbors.

## Key Features Implemented

### Architecture  
- **PuzzleConfig interface**: Extensible JSON structure with id, size, pre-placed positions, and metadata
- **Puzzle catalog**: Hardcoded array of 4 unique 4×4 puzzles with minimal disambiguating sets
- **GridState enhancement**: Added `prePlacedNeighbors` Set for immutable neighbors
- **GridController integration**: `loadPuzzle()` method with automatic state management

### Visual Design System
Implemented 3 distinct visual approaches for pre-placed vs player-placed distinction:

#### Organic Theme (Default)
- **Pre-placed**: Brown (#8B4513) filled-outline style - light fill with dark border
- **Player-placed**: Green (#27ae60) solid circles  
- **Effect**: Subtle, warm aesthetic with clear but non-intrusive distinction

#### Minimal Theme  
- **Pre-placed**: Dark gray (#2c3e50) solid circles
- **Player-placed**: Blue (#3498db) solid circles
- **Effect**: Clean, professional look with color-based distinction

#### Bold Theme
- **Pre-placed**: Purple (#8e44ad) outline-only rounded squares  
- **Player-placed**: Red (#e74c3c) solid rounded squares
- **Effect**: High contrast, geometric styling with shape + fill distinction

### User Interaction
- **Protected pre-placed neighbors**: Cannot be clicked, removed, or modified
- **Standard neighbor placement**: Click empty cells to place/remove player neighbors  
- **Seamless integration**: All existing interaction patterns preserved

## Test Results ✅

- [x] Puzzle loads with correct pre-placed neighbor positions
- [x] Pre-placed neighbors are visually distinct from player-placed neighbors  
- [x] Pre-placed neighbors cannot be removed by player interaction
- [x] Puzzle configuration represents a solvable state
- [x] Puzzle data integrates correctly with internal grid state
- [x] Puzzle data structure supports future batch loading from conversion tool

## Technical Integration

The implementation seamlessly integrates with existing systems:
- **Coordinate consistency**: Uses established zero-indexed GridPosition system
- **Theme compatibility**: Extends existing GridTheme interface 
- **State management**: Compatible with existing undo/redo architecture (when implemented)
- **Future-ready**: Puzzle format designed for mass conversion from compressed data

## Screenshots

Screenshots demonstrate:
1. Initial puzzle load with pre-placed neighbors (brown filled-outline circles)
2. Player interaction - placing new neighbors (green solid circles)  
3. Protection mechanism - pre-placed neighbors unaffected by clicks

The visual distinction is clear and intuitive while maintaining the game's organic aesthetic.
