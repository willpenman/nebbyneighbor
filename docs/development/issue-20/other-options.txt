Font Options Considered for Nebby Neighbor Typography System

SELECTED COMBINATION:
- Title: Fredoka One (tubular, playful - perfect for future "nebby neighbor peeking" graphics)  
- Body: Merriweather (readable serif with warm, established neighborhood feel)

OTHER TITLE FONT OPTIONS CONSIDERED:
- Righteous: Bold, rounded, but still readable
- Comfortaa: More geometric rounded, modern feel  
- Nunito: Softer rounded edges, less extreme

OTHER BODY FONT OPTIONS CONSIDERED:
- Crimson Text: Classic, readable serif
- Playfair Display: Elegant with character
- Source Serif Pro: Clean, modern serif

ALTERNATIVE COMBINATIONS EVALUATED:
1. Fredoka One + Crimson Text (playful + classic)
2. Righteous + Merriweather (bold + readable) 
3. Comfortaa + Source Serif Pro (modern + clean)

RATIONALE FOR FINAL SELECTION:
- Fredoka One's tubular qualities will accommodate future character graphics where a neighbor face peeks out from letters
- Merriweather was specifically designed for screen reading and has excellent legibility
- Combination reinforces neighborhood metaphor: playful title suggests friendly neighbors, serif body text suggests established community
- Typography now supports the grass/land color metaphor with fonts that feel both approachable and grounded
