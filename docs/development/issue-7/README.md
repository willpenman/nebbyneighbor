# Issue #7: Diagnostic Inspection Mode

## Summary

Successfully implemented interactive diagnostic inspection mode with line visualization showing constraint relationships when placing neighbors or clicking forbidden squares.

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Automatic Inspection on Placement
- **Functionality**: Placing a new neighbor immediately enters inspection mode for that neighbor
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows constraint relationship lines for the newly placed neighbor
- **Interaction**: Second click/tap on the same neighbor removes it (responsive interaction)

### ✅ Neighbor Inspection Mode  
- **Functionality**: Clicking on an already-placed neighbor enters inspection mode
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows constraint relationship lines for the clicked neighbor
- **Interaction**: Second click/tap removes the neighbor

### ✅ Line Visualization System
- **Solid Lines**: From first neighbor to second neighbor of each constraint pair
- **Dashed Lines**: Continuing from the second neighbor through the center of forbidden square(s)
- **Multi-Constraint Support**: Handles multiple constraint relationships per neighbor clearly

### ✅ Forbidden Square Inspection Mode
- **Functionality**: Clicking on a forbidden (grayed) square shows which neighbor pairs caused the constraint
- **Visual Feedback**: Draws solid lines between the specific neighbor pair(s) whose line makes this square forbidden
- **Extension Lines**: Shows dashed line continuation through the clicked forbidden square
- **Multi-Cause Support**: Handles multiple overlapping constraints clearly

### ✅ Interactive-Pre: Click-Elsewhere Exit Model
- **Outside Grid**: Clicking outside the grid boundaries exits inspection mode
- **Empty Squares**: Clicking on empty (non-forbidden) squares exits inspection mode and places new neighbor
- **Physical Space**: Adequate padding ensures clickable space around grid on all device sizes
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Touch-friendly with proper margin spacing

### ✅ Line Styling System (Interactive-Post)
Three distinct design approaches implemented:

#### Option 1: Subtle Blue (Default)
- **Colors**: Professional blue (#4285f4) for both solid and dashed lines
- **Style**: Consistent, clean, non-distracting
- **Use Case**: General gameplay, maintains focus on puzzle

#### Option 2: High Contrast (Educational)
- **Colors**: Red solid lines (#e74c3c), orange dashed lines (#f39c12)  
- **Style**: High contrast, educational distinction
- **Use Case**: Learning mode, clear constraint relationship visualization

#### Option 3: Organic Theme (Design Harmony)
- **Colors**: Earth tones matching neighbor colors (#8B7355, #A67C5A)
- **Style**: Harmonious with existing soft organic design theme
- **Use Case**: Aesthetic consistency with overall game design

### ✅ Integration & Performance
- **State Management**: Clean transitions between normal and inspection modes
- **Prevented Invalid Placement**: Forbidden squares cannot be clicked to place neighbors
- **Cross-Compatibility**: Works with both pre-placed and player-placed neighbors
- **Scalability**: Maintains smooth performance on larger grids (tested on 8×8)
- **Multi-Constraint Support**: Handles complex overlapping constraint relationships

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **LineDetector Extensions**: Added `getInspectionData()` and `getForbiddenSquareInfo()` methods
- **GridRenderer Updates**: New constraint line drawing system with configurable styling
- **GridController Integration**: Enhanced click handling for inspection modes
- **GridState Extensions**: Added inspection mode state tracking

### Data Flow
1. **User Interaction** → GridController handles clicks and determines mode
2. **State Update** → GridState tracks current inspection mode and position  
3. **Data Generation** → LineDetector calculates constraint relationships
4. **Visualization** → GridRenderer draws constraint lines with current theme
5. **Exit Handling** → Click-elsewhere pattern clears inspection mode cleanly

## Testing Results

### ✅ Functionality Verification
- [x] Placing new neighbor triggers automatic inspection with constraint lines
- [x] Clicking existing neighbors shows their constraint relationships  
- [x] Second click on inspected neighbor removes it cleanly
- [x] Clicking forbidden squares shows causative neighbor pairs
- [x] Solid lines correctly connect constraint-creating neighbor pairs
- [x] Dashed lines properly extend through forbidden squares
- [x] Multiple overlapping constraints display clearly without visual confusion
- [x] Click-outside-grid exits inspection mode reliably
- [x] Line drawing performance remains smooth on larger grids
- [x] Works correctly with mixed pre-placed and player-placed neighbors

### ✅ Visual Design Validation
- **Professional Appearance**: Clean, educational line visualization
- **Color Accessibility**: High contrast options available for different use cases
- **Design Integration**: Organic theme option maintains visual harmony
- **Mobile Optimization**: Adequate touch targets and margins confirmed

### ✅ User Experience Flow
- **Immediate Feedback**: Automatic inspection on placement provides instant educational value
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Click-elsewhere exit pattern follows common UI conventions
- **Exploration Friendly**: Easy switching between different neighbors for comparison
- **Educational Value**: Clear visualization builds geometric constraint intuition

- `issue-7-dev-loaded.png` - Development interface with theme selector

## Dev Interface

Access via: `http://localhost:3000?issue=7`

Features:
- **Theme Selector**: Switch between 3 line styling approaches
- **Reset Button**: Return to initial puzzle state  
- **Debug Info**: Real-time status updates
- **Live Testing**: Immediate visual feedback for all interaction modes

## Integration Notes

The inspection mode system is designed to integrate seamlessly with future features:
- **Undo/Redo**: Inspection state clears appropriately on history navigation
- **Level Progression**: Works across different grid sizes and puzzle configurations  
- **Accessibility**: Visual lines supplement the existing constraint visualization system
- **Educational Tools**: Foundation for potential hints, tutorials, or guided solving modes

## Conclusion

Issue #7 successfully delivers a comprehensive diagnostic inspection mode that transforms the abstract three-in-line mathematical constraint into an intuitive, visual educational experience. The system provides immediate feedback on neighbor placement while maintaining clean UX patterns and performance at scale.
